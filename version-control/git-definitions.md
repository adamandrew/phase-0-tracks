# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control gives us the ability to go back and forth to different versions.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branch is a version of the code where we can change stuff and not affect the original branch until we decide to merge them.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

Commit makes a save point onto the branch. A good commit message says what changes were made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two different branches have different changes on the same part of code, as a result when we merge the computer doesn't know which branch to use.
