- How to tackle jQuery?
I find that the logic or concept of all the programming languages are all similar, so the biggest difference is the syntax, which can be googled easily. Finding a cheat sheet first will help a lot.
I am a really hands-on person, and reading wall of text will just make me lose concentration. I find the best way I learn is to just start doing something. Since I already understand most of the programming concepts, I can just start doing and refer to a cheat sheet for syntax. In short, finding a practice problem and just start working on it is my plan.

I found W3School's short tutorial helps, and it has example codes on all the different functions. I just need to remember the general syntax of jQuery, and just search up the example code for a function I want to use.
